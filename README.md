# Personal CV Website – Pol Cañadas Costa

This is my personal online Curriculum Vitae, built entirely using HTML and CSS. The goal of this project was to create a responsive, visually appealing, and professional résumé that reflects both my personality and technical skills in web design and front-end structuring.

# Project Analysis – User Profile

When designing this project, I created a clear user persona to define my audience. The main user of this website is a potential recruiter or employer looking for a quick yet insightful overview of my background. This person values clarity, organization, and professional aesthetics. They are likely to browse from a computer or tablet, expecting smooth navigation and easy access to relevant details.

In addition, the CV also targets academic mentors, collaborators, or colleagues who may want to review my technical profile or research interests. Therefore, I designed the layout to highlight essential information such as education, experience, and skills — all presented clearly and concisely, without unnecessary distractions.

# Project Analysis – Information Architecture

The information is structured to guide the reader through a logical and visually balanced flow.
At the top, a blue header introduces my name, degree, and portrait photo, instantly establishing my identity. Below this, the main body is split into two halves:

Left side (light gray background): personal and general information. It includes the “About Me” paragraph, contact details, and language proficiency with visual star ratings. This column provides quick insight into who I am and how to reach me.

Right side (white background): academic and professional sections. It presents my education and notable experiences, each accompanied by institution logos or descriptive text for clarity.

Finally, the page ends with a blue footer bar, which visually closes the CV and balances the overall composition. The information hierarchy ensures that the user naturally reads from top to bottom and left to right, focusing first on identity, then credentials, and finally experience.

# Project Analysis – Visual Design

For the visual design, I followed a clean and modern aesthetic with strong contrasts between sections. The blue gradient header and footer establish a professional yet approachable tone, while the two-column layout brings structure and readability. I chose a light gray background for the left column to visually separate personal data from academic content, enhancing contrast and legibility.

Typography was handled using the Poppins font to ensure clarity and a contemporary feel. Margins, paddings, and box shadows were applied carefully to create depth without visual overload. All icons and images were placed inside an images/ folder for neat organization.

I also centered all section titles, aligned text blocks for visual harmony, and ensured the layout remains responsive for mobile users. The overall goal was to combine aesthetic appeal with functionality, resulting in a CV that feels personal, professional, and consistent with my identity as a computer engineering student.
